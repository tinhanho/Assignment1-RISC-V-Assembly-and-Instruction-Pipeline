[find_msb_ticks.c](https://github.com/tinhanho/Computer-Architecture-Assignment/blob/main/Assignment%202/find_msb_ticks.c) is the code that uses ticks.c to measure cycles.

[find_msb.c](https://github.com/tinhanho/Computer-Architecture-Assignment/blob/main/Assignment%202/find_msb.c) is the code that uses getcycles.s and we mainly use to measure the performance.

[find_msb.s](https://github.com/tinhanho/Computer-Architecture-Assignment/blob/main/Assignment%202/find_msb.s) is generated by rv32emu -O1.

[find_msb_opt.s](https://github.com/tinhanho/Computer-Architecture-Assignment/blob/main/Assignment%202/find_msb_opt.s) is the handwritten code that reduces some cycles.

[getcycles.s](https://github.com/tinhanho/Computer-Architecture-Assignment/blob/main/Assignment%202/getcycles.s) is the assembly code to generate object code and link together.
